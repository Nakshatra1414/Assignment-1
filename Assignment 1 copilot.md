Write a program that determines the total number of columns and rows in the dataset.

To write a program that determines the total number of columns and rows in a dataset, I need to know the format of your dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.). Could you please specify the format or provide a sample file? This will help me generate the correct code for you.

csv

Here is a simple Python program that determines the total number of columns and rows in a CSV dataset:

Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the path to your CSV file. This script prints the total number of columns and rows (excluding the header row). Let me know if you want this saved to a file or need a different language.
